## What is UTP?

The Universal Time Principle reinterprets relativity through a constant-time lens.  
Rather than bending time or space, gravity acts by suppressing the internal processes of matter — decay, emission, oscillation — while time itself remains universally unchanged.

Under UTP:

- Time is universal and constant.
- Spacetime curvature is reinterpreted as suppression gradients (the G-Curve).
- GR/SR math remains, but its meaning shifts: it's not dilation, it's throttling.
- Redshift? It's not a stretch — it's a slow birth cry.

## Core Ideas

- Time flows. Gravity suppresses.  
- The speed of light is constant, but its emission is shaped by gravity.
- GPS corrections, muon decay, and gravitational waves are preserved — but re-explained via process inhibition, not time warping.
- There are no singularities — only G-Barriers where processes halt.
- Quantum decoherence? Not a collapse — a slowdown.

## Where to Next?

The UTP model invites testing. Experimental proposals include:

- Clock networks across altitudes (for suppression gradients)
- Redshift-at-source measurements near massive bodies
- Reinterpretation of LIGO’s phase shifts via re-emission delays
