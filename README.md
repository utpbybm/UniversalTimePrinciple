## What is UTP?

The **Universal Time Principle (UTP)** is a reinterpretation of relativistic phenomena through a constant-time framework. Instead of accepting that time bends under gravity or motion, UTP proposes that **time is universal and unchanging**. What varies are the **rates of physical processes** — decay, oscillation, and emission — all of which become suppressed under gravitational or kinetic conditions.

## Key Principles

- **Time is Constant**: It flows uniformly everywhere; only physical processes change.
- **Suppression, Not Dilation**: Effects like time dilation or length contraction are projections of suppressed processes.
- **G-Curve**: Suppression grows with gravitational intensity, forming a gradient that replaces curved spacetime.
- **Light & UEMF**: Light travels the Universal Electromagnetic Field (UEMF), and is emitted under local suppression — not bent by geometry.
- **No Singularities**: Black holes reach suppression thresholds (G-barriers), not infinite curvature.

## Reinterpreted Phenomena

- **GPS Time Correction**: Not due to time dilation, but to suppressed decay rates.
- **Muon Decay**: High-speed muons live longer due to process suppression.
- **Gravitational Redshift**: Photons are born red due to slow emission under gravity.
- **LIGO**: Fringe shifts are caused by re-emission delay, not spatial stretching.

## Experimental Proposals

- Test redshift emission near strong gravitational fields.
- Measure timing suppression using clock networks at various altitudes.
- Probe LIGO-type devices for re-emission phase modulations.
